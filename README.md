git clone https://github.com/shru2811/Analyza
cd Analyza
```
#### Setup Backend
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
#### Important Links replacement
- Replace all instances of https://analyza-dashboard.onrender.com with http://localhost:5173 (or any port where your frontend works)

- Replace all instances of https://analyza-server.onrender.com with http://localhost:8080 

#### Setup Frontend
